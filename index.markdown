## About

**PennController for Internet Based Experiments** ("PennController" or "PCIbex"
for short) provides the tools to build and run online experiments, from familiar
paradigms like self-paced reading to completely custom-designed paradigms.
<!-- Experiments can be uploaded to or imported from GitHub, making it easy to 
collaborate and share experiments.-->

[The **PCIbex Farm**](https://farm.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"}'s interface comes with [many features]({{site.baseurl}}/announcements/2021-01-22-new-pcibex-farm/)
to help you design and run your experiments, including:
+ a streamlined *editor*, with a *preview* window
+ the possibility to *share* and *copy* projects in a single click ([try it!](https://farm.pcibex.net/r/QuFrkC/){:target="_blank"})
+ and [many more]({{site.baseurl}}/announcements/2021-01-22-new-pcibex-farm/)

PennController was developed and is maintained by
[Jeremy Zehr](https://jeremyzehr.github.io/){:target="_blank"}
and [Florian Schwarz](https://www.florianschwarz.net/){:target="_blank"}
as an extension of
[Ibex](https://ibex.spellout.net/){:target="_blank"},
a JavaScript-based experiment platform by [Alex Drummond](https://adrummond.net/){:target="_blank"}.
PennController uses a streamlined code interface and requires no background in JavaScript.

PennController is under a BSD license, and its source code is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/PennController/penncontroller){:target="_blank"}.

## Acknowledgments

This website was built by [Angelica Pan](https://angelica-pan.com){:target="_blank"}.

PCIbex and the PCIbex farm are maintained by Jeremy Zehr. Initial development of preliminary versions of many of the tools that are part of PennController took place as part of work on NSF-grant BCS-1349009 to Florian Schwarz. The first stages of the full library and first farm were made possible through a grant from Penn's University Research Foundation, titled 'Building a Comprehensive Library for Online Experiments in IBEX.'

## Support PCIbex

Hosting of [the new PCIbex](https://farm.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"} farm is made possible through generous support by [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} - Penn's hub for the integrative study of the mind. Please consider [making a donation](https://giving.apps.upenn.edu/fund?program=SAS&fund=630307){:target="_blank"} to ensure long-term support of this setup, specifying 'PCIbex' under 'special reason' to designate the funds to support PCIbex hosting.
