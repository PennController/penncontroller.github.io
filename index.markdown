## What is PCIbex?

**PCIbex** ("PennController for Ibex"), or PennController, is a free, open-source, versatile, and user-friendly online experiment builder. It provides tools to implement familiar paradigms like self-paced reading or rating studies, and has the flexibility to create custom experimental paradigms. PCIbex is developed by [Jeremy Zehr](https://sites.google.com/site/jeremyezehr/home) within a project in [Florian Schwarz](https://www.florianschwarz.net/)’s [lab](http://lab.florianschwarz.net/). 

PCIbex is an extension of [Ibex](https://github.com/addrummond/ibex/blob/master/docs/manual.md) ("Internet Based EXperiments"), a JavaScript-based platform developed by [Alex Drummond](https://adrummond.net/). PCIbex uses a stream-lined code interface and requires no background in JavaScript. Experiment templates can be directly imported from GitHub, making it easy to share and post experiments.

here's a demo experiment ([timed picture selection](https://expt.pcibex.net/ibexexps/example/TimedPictureSelection/experiment.html))
