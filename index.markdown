## About

**PennController for Internet Based Experiments** ("PennController" or "PCIbex"
for short) provides the tools to build and run online experiments, from familiar
paradigms like self-paced reading to completely custom-designed paradigms.
Experiments can be uploaded to or imported from GitHub, making it easy to
collaborate and share experiments.

PennController was developed and is maintained by
[Jeremy Zehr](https://sites.google.com/site/jeremyezehr/home){:target="_blank"}
and [Florian Schwarz](https://www.florianschwarz.net/){:target="_blank"}
as an extension of
[Ibex](https://github.com/addrummond/ibex/blob/master/docs/manual.md){:target="_blank"},
a JavaScript-based experiment platform by [Alex Drummond](https://adrummond.net/){:target="_blank"}.
PennController uses a streamlined code interface and requires no background in JavaScript.

PennController is under a BSD license, and its source code is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/PennController/penncontroller){:target="_blank"}.
Its development was partly funded through a University Research Foundation
Research Grant from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}
and is currently supported by the
[ILST initiative at MindCORE](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/){:target="_blank"}.
