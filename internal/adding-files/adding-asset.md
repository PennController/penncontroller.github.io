Images and other static resource files go in the [`assets/`]({{site.baseurl}}/internal/directory-structure/assets) folder. 

As of September 3, 2020 there are two subfolders:

+ `assets/elements/`: Contains the element type thumbnail PNG files.
+ `assets/images/`: Contains all other images files.
+ `assets/prism/`: Contains the JS script and CSS style sheet for the Prism syntax highlighter.

Other subfolders may be added as needed.
