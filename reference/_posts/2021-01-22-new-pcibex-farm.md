## Is my code automatically migrated to the new platform? 

Shortly, no. You have to migrate your experiments to the new farm. See below for the instructions on how to do it.

## How to migrate experiments to the new farm?

1. Go to the front page of your experiment in the old farm (expt platform) and scroll
down until you see the following:
    ![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/new1.png)

    Press "download a zip archive" in order to save the copy of the experiment to your
    computer.
2. Start a project from the Empty Project on the new farm.

3. Drag and drop project files from your computer to the following section in the
code editor on the farm:
    ![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/new3.png)
4. Rename your project file!
    ![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/new4.png)

You are all set!
