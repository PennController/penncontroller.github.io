The University of Pennsylvania will be hosting the [Experiments in Linguistic Meaning conference](https://www.elm-conference.net/){:target="_blank"}, September 16-18, 2020.

As part of social events surrounding the conference, I will be giving an introduction and demonstration of PCIbex this Thursday (09/17) at 11:30am-12pm EST on [the conference’s CampusWire group](https://www.elm-conference.net/2020-conference/virtual-event-information/campuswire/){:target="_blank"}. I will also answer general questions about PCIbex’s capabilities.

You can register for the conference by following [this link](https://www.elm-conference.net/2020-conference/registration/){:target="_blank"}.
