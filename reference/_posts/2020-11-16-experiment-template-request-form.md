Do you have a paradigm you’d like to try out on PCIbex, but need help getting started?
We’re currently compiling an inventory of experimental paradigm templates – please
fill out the form below if you want to put in any requests! These could be tasks
from classic paradigms (or variations thereof), replications of your own prior work,
or entirely new ones (with some potential for broader relevance and general interest)!
