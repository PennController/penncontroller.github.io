title:  Maintenance - servers to go down Monday 05/25/2020 6-7pm EST

**Update: services back up & running at 7:20pm EST**

The servers will go down temporarily on Monday, May 24 between 6pm and 7pm EST for maintenance. As a consequence, the PCIbex Farm (and possibly this website) will not be accessible: you will not be able to design experiments or collect data during that time window.

The maintenance operations will both address some of the slowdown issues our servers have been experiencing, and install a new release of PennController (1.8) as prepackaged in newly created experiments.
