Dear PCIbex users,

As you may have noticed, we have been facing repeated outages on the public farm 
at https://farm.pcibex.net/ in the last few days (the UPenn farm is not affected by this). 
In order to assess the situation more thoroughly, we have decided that **it will unfortunately 
be necessary to suspend data collection for a few days** - the exact timing is hard to predict, 
but we hope to having things back up soon, and will keep you posted through this list.

We realize that there are many aspects of users interacting with the farm beyond data collection, 
especially in terms of project development and testing out code. **We are therefore not taking 
the farm completely offline** (and it is back online now), but **be prepared for intermittent 
and unannounced outages** due to maintenance and update operations from our end. 
Existing results files will also remain accessible. So the main concrete change in suspending 
data collection will be that the **data-collection links will be temporarily deactivated across 
the board for all experiments**. That way, any participants from recruitment platforms that still 
try to access an experiment will not be able to start taking it, avoiding unnecessary hassle from 
participants going through an entire experiment but faltering at the ‘send results’ section 
at the end (and there data not being recorded). However, it will of course be the **best practice 
for everyone in the meantime to pause data collection on recruitment platforms**, so that 
no participants try to take an experiment but can’t load it.

For **anyone that is under urgent time-pressure to collect data**, there are some **alternative options** in the meantime: 
first, you can move your project to another farm instance (e.g., the previous PCIbex farm or the original IBEX farm), 
as you can still download the entire project; this is relatively straightforward for simple projects, 
but if you have resources (e.g., audio or image files)  are loading zip-files, or are collecting audio- or video-recordings, 
more adjustments may be necessary (e.g., host your resources externally, and update your server settings for the source of 
requests to access zip-files/upload permissions for recordings etc. to the farm you are using). Note that if you have access 
to a web-server and control over all the relevant settings and configurations, you can also download a stand-alone version of 
your experiment and collect data on your own server.

We understand this may create difficulties and are very sorry for the inconvenience. 
The popularity and corresponding usage levels of the new farm are giving rise to new issues, 
especially in relation to the intricate configurations on the AWS platform, that we weren’t facing until 
usage peaks of various sorts started happening, and could thus not be foreseen. We hope to have these issues ironed out soon, 
and will keep users up to date of any developments either way.

Best,

Jeremy & Florian
