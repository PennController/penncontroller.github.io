**Workshop Description:**

This workshop introduces [PennController for IBEX (PCIbex)]({{site.baseurl}}){:target="_blank"},
a **free and open-source** platform for designing, implementing and hosting online
experiments, of use to anyone collecting behavioral experimental data in the cognitive
sciences and beyond. In the workshop, you will reproduce
[this simple experiment](https://expt.pcibex.net/ibexexps/example/TimedPictureSelection/experiment.html){:target="_blank"}
to introduce you to core features. Along the way, you will learn how to develop
and host experiments on [the PCIbex Farm](https://expt.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"},
which comes with its own interface and requires
**no server setup, software installation or prior knowledge of a programming language**.
Focusing on fundamental concepts and the basic logic of the interface, this workshop
will be useful both to students and researchers new to online experiments and ones
with prior experience on other platforms.

**More about PennController for IBEX:**

PCIbex builds on IBEX, a free, javacript-based platform for running experiments online,
developed by Alex Drummond to conduct common text-based, psycho-linguistic tasks,
including self-paced reading and rating studies. PCIbex is an extension developed by
Jeremy Zehr within a project in Florian Schwarzâ€™s lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
It uses a **versatile** and **user-friendly** yet powerful mini-script languag
(requiring no javascript skills) for incorporating a diverse range of features
in your experiment, such as multimedia support and dynamically unfolding trial
structures, with the capacity of **tracking timing and inputs** throughout,
to accommodate both simple and complex experimental task paradigms with a wide
range of dynamic and interactive features (e.g., visual stimuli, flexible,
multi-stage trial structure, response feedback, scripted/ timed events,
playing audio and video).

Free hosting offered at
[https://expt.pcibex.net/](https://expt.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"}
means posting simple experiments online just takes a few simple steps that can be
shared through a URL. This is compatible with a variety of recruitment platforms,
e.g., **SONA, Prolific, or Mechanical Turk**. Templates or prior experiments can
easily be imported via **GitHub**, which also allows for easy sharing of your work
for **maximal transparency and replicability**.

[documentation]({{site.baseurl}}){:target="_blank"}, as well as the
[support forum](https://www.pcibex.net/forums/forum/support/){:target="_blank"}.
