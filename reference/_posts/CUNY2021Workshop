**Workshop Description:**
---------------------------

This workshop introduces [PCIbex](https://www.pcibex.net/), a **free and open-source** platform for designing, implementing and hosting online experiments, of use to anyone collecting behavioral experimental data in the cognitive sciences and beyond. In the first part of the workshop, we will begin by introducing basic features and functionalities by reproducing and expanding on [this simple experiment](https://farm.pcibex.net/r/QuFrkC/). Along the way, you will learn how to develop and host experiments on the ([NEW and IMPROVED](https://doc.pcibex.net/announcements/2021-01-22-new-pcibex-farm/)) [PCIbex Farm](https://farm.pcibex.net/) platform, which comes with its own interface and requires **no server setup, software installation or prior knowledge of a programming language**. Focusing on fundamental concepts and the basic logic of the interface, this workshop will be useful both to students and researchers new to online experiments and ones with prior experience on othger platforms. The second part of the workshop will point to some more advanced functionalities, including audio and video recording as well as the integration of the WebGazer API for eye tracking, and also provide the chance for Q&A and general discussion.

**More about PCIbex:**
----------------------

The PCIbex Farm, at <https://farm.pcibex.net/>, is a web platform serving two key functions: providing a **simple coding interface** for implementing experimental designs, and sharing the resulting experiments via web browser both for **data collection** and **Open Science** resource sharing. The platform builds on [IBEX](https://ibex.spellout.net/) (Drummond, 2007), but expands its capabilities and makes a much wider range of tasks easily accessible through the PennController.js library; the new PCIbex Farm also offers an [overhauled design interface and numerous new functionalities](https://doc.pcibex.net/announcements/2021-01-22-new-pcibex-farm/).

PCIbex uses its own mini-language (requiring no JavaScript or other prior programming skills) that provides the flexibility to integrate a wide range of dynamic and interactive features in your experiments, including:

-   multimedia stimuli: images, audio and video
-   recording audio and video responses
-   eye-tracking via the WebGazer API ([Papoutsaki et al.](https://www.ijcai.org/Abstract/16/540), 2016)
-   self-paced reading
-   scripted/ timed events, dynamically unfolding trial structure
-   response feedback\
The **new user-friendly interface** provides easy access to all main features on a single page, comes with various **templates** and allows easy import of existing projects. Experiments can be **instantly shared via a link**, with easy integration of a variety of recruitment platforms, (SONA, Prolific, Mechanical Turk). A (fully anonymous) 'demonstration' link facilitates public access to the actual experiment experience, e.g., during review and for readers of papers. It also comes with a link for **cloning the experiment**, with full access to underlying code and resources to **promote Open Science practices**, allowing for replication with a single click.

A more detailed 2-page overview of both the platform and the tutorial can be found [here](https://www.pcibex.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PCIbex_TutorialAbstract.pdf).
