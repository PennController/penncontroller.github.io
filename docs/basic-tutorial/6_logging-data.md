By default, PennController logs only when a trial starts and when it ends. You must use the `log` command to collect any other information. 

The `log` command adds lines to the `results` file in the **Results** folder. The information that is added depends on the element type that the `log` command is called on.

{% capture label %}
To learn what information is added by calling `log` on a specific element type, visit that element type’s reference page under [Elements]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/elements).
{% endcapture %}
{% include reference-label.html label-body=label %}

Log information from the `"keypress"` **Key** element:

```javascript
// This is the BasicTutorial experiment.
// Type code below this line.

// Remove command prefix
PennController.ResetPrefix(null)

newTrial("first-trial",
    newText("instructions", "Press the F key if the image on the left matches the sentence. Presss the K key if the image on the right matches the sentence.")
        .center()
        .italic()
        .print()
    ,
    newText("fish-description", "The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round.")
        .center()
        .print()
    ,
    newImage("fish-round", "2fishRoundTank.png")    
        .size(200, 200)
        // .print()
    ,
    newImage("fish-square", "1fishSquareTank.png")
        .size(200, 200)
        // .print()
    , 
   	newCanvas("side-by-side", 450,200)
        .add(  0, 0, getImage("fish-round"))
        .add(250, 0, getImage("fish-square"))
        .center()
        .print()
    ,
    newKey("keypress", "FJ")
         .wait()
         .log()
)
```

### Examining results

To look at the logged information, do the following:

1. Save and close the `main.js` file.
2. In the **Results** folder, delete any existing files.
3. Click the link at the top of the experiment project page to run the experiment.
4. Complete the experiment.
5. Click the **Results** folder refresh icon.
6. Open the `results` file:
   + Click on *results* to open the `results` file as a pop-up window in the experiment project page; or
   + Click on the eye icon under *results* to open the `results` file in a new tab; or
   + Right-click on the eye icon, click *Save Link As...*, enter `"results.csv"` in the "Save As:" field, and click **Save** to save the `results` file as a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

The `results` file should look like the following:

```
#
# Results on...
# USER...
# Design number...
#
# Columns below this comment are as follows:
# 1. Time results were received.
# 2. MD5 hash of participant's IP address.
# 3. Controller name.
# 4. Item number.
# 5. Element number.
# 6. Type.
# 7. Group.
# 8. PennElementType.
# 9. PennElementName.
# 10. Parameter.
# 11. Value.
# 12. EventTime.
# 13. Comments.
1598318358,<SOME_MD5_HASH>,PennController,0,0,first-trial,NULL,PennController,0,_Trial_,Start,1598318337952,NULL
1598318358,<SOME_MD5_HASH>,PennController,0,0,first-trial,NULL,Key,keypress,PressedKey,F,1598318340287,Wait success
1598318358,<SOME_MD5_HASH>,PennController,0,0,first-trial,NULL,PennController,0,_Trial_,End,1598318340291,NULL
```

Rows that begin with the pound symbol `#` are either:

+ Comments that either provide logging meta-information; or
+ Column names for the comma-separated values. 

The three rows of interest are at the bottom, and do not begin with a pound symbol:

+ The first row logs the start of the `"first-trial"` **Trial**. 
  + `<...>,_Trial_,Start,1598318337952,<...>`
  +  The trial started at the timestamp `1598318337952`
+ The second row logs data from the `"keypress"` **Key**.
  + `<...>,Key,keypress,PressedKey,F,1598318340287,<...>`
  + The participant pressed the `F` key at the timestamp `1598318340287`
+ The third row logs the end of the `"first-trial"` **Trial**.
  + `<...>,_Trial_,End,1598318340291,<...>`
  + The trial ended at the timestamp `1598318340291`

The timestamps can be used to calculate response times. For example, subtract the trial start timestamp from the keypress timestamp: `1598318340287-1598318337952=2335`; the participant took 2335 ms to press the key.

### Wrapping up

Congratulations! You’ve created an experiment that

- Contains multiple elements, 
- Controls element aesthetics,
- Interacts with the participant through a keypress,
- Logs experiment data.

Check out the final experiment here: [BasicTutorial](https://expt.pcibex.net/ibexexps/angelicapan/basicTutorial/experiment.html).

We hope that you feel like you now have a basic understand of PennController.
