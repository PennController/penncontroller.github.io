The easiest way to use PCIbex, or PennController, is to use the [PCIbex Farm](https://expt.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"} server, which provides free hosting for PennController experiments. The PCIbex hosts and builds PennController experiments automatically, meaning that you don't have to worry about set up, and can focus on writing your experiment scripts. 

You can also set up your own server by following the instructions in the [Using an external server]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/how-to-guides/setting-up-server){:target="_blank"} how-to guide.

Each PCIbex Farm account has a **64MB storage quota**, meaning that the total size of all files across all experiments cannot exceed 64MB. If you exceed this limit, you will not be able to upload new files or save any changes.

To restore your account:
+ Delete files until total file size is under 64MB.
+ Send an email to [support@pcibex.net](mailto:support@pcibex.net) to be taken off the exceed-quota list.

## Creating a PCIbex Farm account

1. Go to the PCIbex Farm [account creation page](https://expt.pcibex.net/login).
2. In the "New user" box, enter the following information:
   + In the "Username" field, enter the username that you want for your account.
   + In the "Password" field, enter the password that you want for your account.
   + In the "Verify password field", re-enter the password that you used in the "Password" field.
   + (*Optional*) In the "Email" field, enter the email that you want to link your acccount to. PCIbex Farm does not share your email, and only sends emails for password retrieval purposes.
3. Click **Create account**.
