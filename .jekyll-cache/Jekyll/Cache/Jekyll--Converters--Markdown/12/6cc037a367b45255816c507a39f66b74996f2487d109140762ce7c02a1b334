<p>You can upload an entire GitHub repository to the PCIbex Farm. This is particularly useful if you would like to upload multiple files to the <strong>Resources</strong> folder, and do not want to upload each file one-by-one.</p>

<p>The GitHub repository must have one or more of the following folders in the root directory:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>data_includes</strong>: Its contents will be copied into the <strong>Scripts</strong> folder.</li>
  <li><strong>chunk_includes</strong>: Its contents will be copied into the <strong>Resources</strong> folder.</li>
  <li><strong>js_includes</strong>: Its contents will be copied into the <strong>Controllers</strong> folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of an appropriate GitHub repository structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github-repository
├── README.md
├── data_includes
│   └── main.js
├── chunk_includes
│   ├── image1.png
│   └── image2.png
└── js_includes
    └── newController.js
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Before uploading a GitHub repository, you should know that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No Git repository is hosted on the PCIbex Farm server. The specified repository is checked out, and its files are uploaded to your experiment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Caution!</strong> Files with the same names will be replaced. Any file in a PCIbex experiment folder will be overwritten by a file with the same name in an uploaded GitHub repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any file in a PCIbex experiment folder but not in an uploaded GitHub repository will not be affected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No files are ever copied to the <strong>Results</strong> folder, to ensure that results are never overwritten by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The repository checkout times out after 25 seconds. If this happens, just try again. If you are trying to check out a very large repository, you may have to reduce the size of the repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently, it is only possible to upload a publicly readable Git repository.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To upload through Github:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Under <strong>Experiment ‘EXPERIMENT_NAME’</strong>, click <strong>Update from git repo »</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the grey text input box, enter the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>In the “repo url” field, enter the URL of the GitHub repository that you are copying.</li>
      <li>In the “branch/revision” field, enter the branch of the GitHub repository that you are copying.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Sync</strong>.</li>
  <li>If the uploading was successful, the uploaded files will appear in the appropriate folder(s) and briefly flash red.</li>
</ol>
