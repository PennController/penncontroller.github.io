    "doc": "Add elements",
    "title": "Add elements",
    "content": "Elements are the basic unit of a PennController experiment. Element types can represent visual content, interactive content, or some combination of the two: . | Text: Represents text content (visual). | Image: Represents image content (visual) | Key: Represents keyboard keypresses (interactive). | Button: Represents clickable buttons (visual and interactive). | . note This tutorial uses the term “element” as shorthand for “instance of an element type”. For example “an Image element” or “an Image” is short for “an instance of the Image type”. If “element type” is intended, the term “element type” will be used. Elements are created with the newX(\"ELEMENT_NAME\", ...) function, where X is an element type. The first argument is a string, and the name of the newly-created element. Any subsequent arguments depend on the element type. reference To learn which arguments a specific element type requires, visit that element type’s reference page under Elements. Elements that already exist can be referred back to with the getX(\"ELEMENT_NAME\") function, where X is an element type and \"ELEMENT_NAME\" is the name of the element. Elements and any commands that are called on them are separated by a comma. Add a Text element and an Image element: . // Shorten command names (keep this line here) PennController.ResetPrefix(null) // Create a Trial named \"first-trial\" newTrial(\"first-trial\", // Create a Text element newText(\"fish-description\", \"The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round.\") , // Create an Image element newImage(\"fish-round\", \"2fishRoundTank.png\") ) . | The Text element is named \"fish-description\", and contains the string The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round. | The Image element is named \"fish\", and contains the image 2fishRoundTank.png, which is inside the Resources folder. | . recommended It is not strictly necessary to name an element. For example, newImage(\"fish\", \"2fishRoundTank.png\") and newImage(\"2fishRoundTank.png\") both contain the image 2fishRoundTank.png. However, it is recommended to name every element for general clarity. Furthermore, if you want to refer back to an existing element with the getX function, the element must have a name. ",

    "doc": "Add commands",
    "title": "Add commands",
    "content": "Elements contain content; element commands do things with that content. For example, once you create an element, you can use an element command to print it to the screen. There are three types of commands: . | Element commands are used within a trial to manipulate elements. | Global commands are used outside of a trial to manipulate the experiment as a whole. | Special commands are used within a trial, but do not manipulate elements. | . note Element commands are the most common type of command. This tutorial uses the term “command” as shorthand for “element command”. If a global or special command is intended, the term “global command” or “special command” will be used. Commands are standard (can be called on any element type) or element-specific (can only be called on a specific element type): . | Standard commands begin with the prefix standard. , for example standard.print | Element-specific commands begin with the prefix X., where X is an element type, for example text.unfold | . note This tutorial omits the prefix standard. when referring to standard commands. The syntax for calling a command on an element is newX(\"ELEMENT_NAME\", ...).COMMAND() or getX(\"ELEMENT_NAME\").COMMAND(), where COMMAND is the name of a comment without its standard or element-specific prefix. recommended Successive commands can be called on the same line, as in getX(\"ELEMENT_NAME\").COMMAND_1().COMMAND_2().COMMAND_3(). However, it is recommended to call each command on an indented new line for readability. Use the print command to print the \"fish-description\" and \"fish\" elements to the screen: . // Shorten command names (keep this line here) PennController.ResetPrefix(null) // Create a Trial named \"first-trial\" newTrial(\"first-trial\", // Create a Text element and print it newText(\"fish-description\", \"The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round.\") .print() , // Create an Image element and print it newImage(\"fish-round\", \"2fishRoundTank.png\") .print() ) . Click Save and test in the script editor to test your changes. You may be surprised by the results! As soon as you start the experiment, you see the message “The results were successfully sent to the server. Thanks!”. While it may seem like nothing happened, all of the commands were executed within a few milliseconds, and the experiment ended almost immediately. PennController executes experiment scripts sequentially: . | Shorten command names. | Create a Trial. | Create a Text element and print it. | Create an Image element and print it. | . If there are no more commands, the trial ends. If there are no more trials, the experiment ends. Pause experiment execution . Interactive elements and commands can pause experiment script execution, in order to give participants time to interact with the screen. For example, all interactive element types have a wait command: . | audio.wait: Waits until the Audio file is done playing before evaluating and executing the next commands. | button.wait: Waits until the Button is clicked before evaluating and executing the next commands. | key.wait: Waits until the Key is pressed before evaluating and executing the next commands. | Also: controller.wait, dropdown.wait, scale.wait, and more. | . Although these commands are related in name and function, they are still considered element-specific commands for technical reasons. Use a Key element and the key.wait command to pause experiment execution: . // Shorten command names (keep this line here) PennController.ResetPrefix(null) // Create a Trial named \"first-trial\" newTrial(\"first-trial\", // Create a Text element and print it newText(\"fish-description\", \"The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round.\") .print() , // Create an Image element and print it newImage(\"fish-round\", \"2fishRoundTank.png\") .print() , // Create a Key element and wait until the F or J key is pressed newKey(\"keypress\", \"FJ\") .wait() ) . | Once the key.wait command on the Key element is reached, the experiment “waits” until the participant presses the F or J key. | After the F or J key is pressed, there are no more commands or trials, and the experiment ends. | .

Manipulate layout . By default, every printed element is printed on a new line. For any other layout, use a Canvas, which creates a transparent surface that can be used to place elements at specific coordinates. Define a 450x200 px Canvas and print the \"fish-round\" and \"fish-square\" Image elements next to each other with a 50px gap: . // Shorten command names (keep this line here) PennController.ResetPrefix(null) // Create a Trial named \"first-trial\" newTrial(\"first-trial\", // Create a Text element, center it, and print it newText(\"fish-description\", \"The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round.\") .center() .print() , // Create an Image element, resize it to 200x200 px, and print it newImage(\"fish-round\", \"2fishRoundTank.png\") .size(200, 200) // .print() , // Create another Image element, resize it 200x200 px, and print it newImage(\"fish-square\", \"1fishSquareTank.png\") .size(200, 200) // .print() , newCanvas(\"side-by-side\", 450,200) .add( 0, 0, getImage(\"fish-round\")) .add(250, 0, getImage(\"fish-square\")) .print() , // Create a Key element and wait until the F or J key is pressed newKey(\"keypress\", \"FJ\") .wait() ) . | \"fish-round\" is added to the (x=0, y=0) coordinate of the \"side-by-side\" Canvas. | \"fish-square\" is added to the (x=250, y=0) coordinate of the \"side-by-side\" Canvas. | If you call print on a Canvas element, do not call print directly on the elements that have been added to the Canvas. | . Add instructions . As the writers of the BasicTutorial experiment, we know that the \"first-trial\" Trial waits for the participant to press the F or J key before the experiment continues. However, a naive participant has no way of knowing this. Add a Text element with instructions: . // Shorten command names (keep this line here) PennController.ResetPrefix(null) // Create a Trial named \"first-trial\" newTrial(\"first-trial\", // Add instructions newText(\"instructions\", \"Press the F key if the image on the left matches the sentence.

It provides tools to implement familiar paradigms like self-paced reading or rating studies, and has the flexibility to create custom experimental paradigms. PCIbex is developed by Jeremy Zehr within a project in Florian Schwarz’s lab. PCIbex is an extension of Ibex (“Internet Based EXperiments”), a JavaScript-based platform developed by Alex Drummond. PCIbex uses a stream-lined code interface and requires no background in JavaScript. Experiment templates can be directly imported from GitHub, making it easy to share and post experiments. here’s a demo experiment (timed picture selection) . ",
