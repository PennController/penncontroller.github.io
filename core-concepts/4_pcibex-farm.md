The easiest way to use PCIbex, or PennController, is to use the
[PCIbex Farm](https://expt.pcibex.net/){:target="_blank"} server,
which provides free hosting for PennController experiments. The PCIbex Farm
hosts and builds PennController experiments automatically, meaning that you
don't have to worry about set up, and can focus on writing your experiment scripts.

You can also set up your own server by following the instructions in the
[Using an external server]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/how-to-guides/setting-up-server){:target="_blank"}
how-to guide.

Each PCIbex Farm account has a **64MB storage quota**, meaning that the total size
of all files across all experiments cannot exceed 64MB. If you exceed this limit,
you will not be able to upload new files or save any changes.

To restore your account:

+ Delete files until total file size is under 64MB.
+ Send an email to [support@pcibex.net](mailto:support@pcibex.net) to be taken off
the exceed-quota list.
