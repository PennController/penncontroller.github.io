## Experimental design

In the [**Basic Tutorial**]({{site.baseurl}}/basic-tutorial){:target="_blank"},
we created a simple picture matching "experiment" with a single trial and
no real research question. In the **Advanced Tutorial**, we add our research question:

> What is the time course of interpreting English agreement morphology, 
 n particular the third person singular inflectional morpheme *-s*?

Experimental design:

+ 2 conditions: singular verb inflection and plural verb inflection
+ 4 experimental items per condition: 8 items total
+ Within-item: across participants, each item occurs in both conditions
+ Within-participant: every participant sees items from both conditions

The within-item, within-participant design results in an experiment with two lists/groups.

**Experimental items**: 

| group | item | sentence                                         | inflection |
|-------|------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| A     | 1    | The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round | plural     |
| A     | 2    | The deer runs in a wood which is extremely dense | singular   |
| A     | 3    | The sheep roam in a pen which is strikingly blue | plural     |
| A     | 4    | The moose walks in a park which is visibly new   | singular   |

| group | item | sentence                                           | inflection |
|-------|------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| B     | 1    | The fish swims in a tank which is perfectly square | singular   |
| B     | 2    | The deer run in a wood which is extremely sparse   | plural     |
| B     | 3    | The sheep roams in a pen which is strikingly red   | singular   |
| B     | 4    | The moose walk in a park which is visibly old      | plural     |

## Trial templates

Each iteration of the **Tutorial** experiment has four items and thus
four trials. 

We could copy-and-paste the `"experimental-trial"` trial code multiple times
and change variable names as necessary, but this method is not recommended
for several reasons:

+ Prone to copy-and-paste errors, like forgetting to change a source file name.
+ Difficult to make changes to general trial structure, because each
copy-and-pasted trial must be updated individually.
+ Greatly increases overall length of experiment script.

Instead, we'll use the global command
[`Template`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/template){:target="_blank"}
to define a trial template.

A trial template, as its name suggests, is a template for creating trials.
In other words, a trial template is a sample trial that is partially complete,
and has some values that will be added in "later". In the trial template,
these values are represented by variables. During the actual script evaluation,
PennController fills in the value of the variables with values from a specified table.

Tables are CSV (comma separated value) files imported into an experiment page's
**Resources** folder, or defined within an experiment script
(read the global command
[`AddTable`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/addtable){:target="_blank"}).

### Trial template syntax

The `Template` global command has the following syntax:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
PennController.ResetPrefix(null)

Template("<var>TABLE_NAME</var>", <var>row</var> => 
    newTrial("TRIAL_LABEL",
        newX("ELEMENT_1", row.<var>COLUMN_NAME</var>)
            .COMMAND_1()
    )
)
</code></pre>

+ <code>"<var>TABLE_NAME</var>"</code> is the name of a table.
  + If no table is specified, PennController defaults to the table whose name
  comes first in alphanumeric order.  
  + If there are no tables, the entire trial template is skipped during
  experiment script evaluation. If the debugger is on, it will display an error message.
+ <code><var>row</var></code> is an array variable that contains the values
of a table row.
  + This tutorial names the array variable `row`, but you can use
  the name of your choice.
  + PennController creates trials iteratively. In the first iteration,
  `row` contains the values of the first table row. In the second iteration,
  `row` contains the values of the second table row, and so on.
+ <code><var>COLUMN_NAME</var></code> is the name of a column in the table
specified by <code>"<var>TABLE_NAME</var>"</code>
  + `row.COLUMN_NAME` is a variable whose value is the value in the specified
  table column, for a given iteration/row.
  + Use `row["COLUMN_NAME"]` instead of `row.COLUMN_NAME` if the column name
  contains special characters like spaces, commas, periods, or dashes.

### Using a table

We'll use the `items.csv` table, imported as a resource file in
[1.1.3 Importing resource files]({{site.baseurl}}/basic-tutorial/1_setting-up#importing-resource-files),
to fill in our trial template:

*Note: You may need to scroll to the right to see all the columns.*

| group | item | sentence                                           | inflection | audio               | duration | singular_image      | plural_image        |
|-------|------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| A     | 1    | The fish swim in a tank which is perfectly round   | plural     | 2fishRoundTank.mp3  | 2676     | 1fishSquareTank.png | 2fishRoundTank.png  |
| A     | 2    | The deer runs in a wood which is extremely dense   | singular   | 1deerDenseWood.mp3  | 2650     | 1deerDenseWood.png  | 2deerSparseWood.png |
| A     | 3    | The sheep roam in a pen which is strikingly blue   | plural     | 2sheepBluePen.mp3   | 2598     | 1sheepRedPen.png    | 2sheepBluePen.png   |
| A     | 4    | The moose walks in a park which is visibly new     | singular   | 1mooseNewPark.mp3   | 2546     | 1mooseNewPark.png   | 2mooseOldPark.png   |
| B     | 1    | The fish swims in a tank which is perfectly square | singular   | 1fishSquareTank.mp3 | 2833     | 1fishSquareTank.png | 2fishRoundTank.png  |
| B     | 2    | The deer run in a wood which is extremely sparse   | plural     | 2deerSparseWood.mp3 | 2650     | 1deerDenseWood.png  | 2deerSparseWood.png |
| B     | 3    | The sheep roams in a pen which is strikingly red   | singular   | 1sheepRedPen.mp3    | 2755     | 1sheepRedPen.png    | 2sheepBluePen.png   |
| B     | 4    | The moose walk in a park which is visibly old      | plural     | 2mooseOldPark.mp3   | 2441     | 1mooseNewPark.png   | 2mooseOldPark.png   |

PennController automatically detects if a table has a column named `group`
or `list` (case-insensitive). If such a column exists, PennController uses
its values to subset the table rows into groups. If no such column exists,
all of the table rows form a single group. 

PennController's internal counter determines which group is run, and by default
the counter increases by one at the end of an experiment. The **Tutorial**
experiment has two groups, meaning that the `A` and `B` groups are run
in alternating order.

Although the `items.csv` table has eight rows (excluding the header),
a participant sees only four trials, generated from either the `A` group or `B` group.

### Creating a trial template

1. Comment out the `DebugOff` command to re-enable the debugger.
2. Create a trial template using the `items.csv` table.

## Logging trial details

When we [examine the collected data](#examining-data), it will be important
to know which group was run, which lines in the `results` file belong
to which items, and which verbal inflection condition each item had.

Use the `log("COLUMN_NAME", VALUE)` method to add a column to an experiment's
`results` file. The column is only added to rows that log information about
the trial that the `log` method is called on.

+ `"COLUMN_NAME"` is the name of the column that will be added to the `results` file.
+ `VALUE` is the value that will be added to each row of the `results` file,
in the column created by `"COLUMN_NAME"`.

The [`log` method]({{site.baseurl}}/global-commands/newtrial#methods){:target="_blank"}
and the [`log` command]({{site.baseurl}}/basic-tutorial/#logging-data)
are similar, but differ in important ways:

+ The `log` method adds columns, the `log` command adds rows.
+ The `log` method is called on a trial, the `log` command is called on an element.

{% capture instructions %}
Use the [`log` method]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/newtrial#methods){:target="_blank"}
on the `"experimental-item"` trial to record the group, item number,
and verbal inflection condition.
