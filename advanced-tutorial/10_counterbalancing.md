## Shuffling image position

In the current experimental design, the plural image is always printed on the left and the singular image is always printed on the right. 

It's possible that participants are simply always faster at choosing images on the left (or on the right). This reaction time advantage would create a confound that could lead to an incorrect conclusion about morphological processing.

{% capture instructions %}
Call the [`shuffle`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-shuffle){:target="_blank"} command on the `"selection"` **Selector** to shuffle the horizontal position of the `"plural"` and `"singular"` `Image` elements.

{% capture label %}
Call the `shuffle` command **before** calling the `keys` command, so that the `F` key is associated with whichever image is printed on the left, and the `J` key is associated with whichever image is printed on the right. 

If you call the `keys` command before calling the `shuffle` command, it is possible that the `F` key becomes associated with the image on the right, and the `J` key with the image on the left.

The `shuffle` command shuffles the image positions for every `"experimental-item"` trial independently, meaning that within an iteration of the **AdvancedTutorial** experiment it's still possible for the plural image to be printed on the left for all four experimental items.

Another way of counterbalancing is to explicitly set half of the items to display the plural image on the left, and the other half to display the plural image on the right. In this experiment, we use the `shuffle` command, but include the hardcoded counterbalancing for reference:

## Randomizing item order

By default, PennController executes experiment scripts from top to bottom. The global command [`Sequence`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/sequence){:target="_blank"}, which is a handler for the Ibex [shuffleSequence variable](https://github.com/addrummond/ibex/blob/master/docs/manual.md#shuffle-sequences){:target="_blank"}, allows you to specify a shuffle sequence instead. 

A shuffle sequence is a way to sequence or randomize an array of items, in this case the PennController trials. Randomizing the order of the experimental items is a way to control for order effects. 

The `Sequence` global command can create a wide variety of shuffle sequences using type predicates (predicates, for short), and the functions `seq`, `randomize`, `shuffle`, and `rshuffle`.

For the **AdvancedTutorial** experiment, the important parts to know are that:

+ Predicates can be trial labels. 
+ `Sequence(PREDICATE_1, PREDICATE_2, ...)` creates a sequence in which all trials that match `PREDICATE_1` precede all trials that match `PREDICATE_2`, and so on. 
+ `randomize(PREDICATE)` creates a sequence in which all trials that match `PREDICATE` are randomly ordered. 
+ Trials that do not match a `PREDICATE` are not run.

{% capture instructions %}
Use the [`Sequence`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/sequence){:target="_blank"}` global command to run the four `"experimental-trial"` trials in a random order:

<pre><code class="language-diff-javascript diff-highlight"> 
@// Type code below this line.
@
@// Remove command prefix
@PennController.ResetPrefix(null)
@
@// Turn off debugger
@// DebugOff()
@
+// Control trial sequence
+Sequence("instructions", randomize("experimental-trial"), "send", "completion_screen")
@
@// code omitted in the interest of space
</code></pre>
{% endcapture %}
{% include instructions.html text=instructions%}

## Controlling group assignment

PennController uses an internal counter to counterbalance group assignment. By default, the counter increases by one at the end of an experiment, which rotates which experimental item group is run.

Other options for controlling group assignment:
+ Use the global command [`SetCounter`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/setcounter){:target="_blank"} to manually control the internal counter.
+ Modify the experiment URL to force assignment to a specific group.

To modify the experiment URL, replace `experiment.html` with `server.py?withsquare=N`, where `N` is a number from 0 to number-of-groups-minus-one. This method is useful if you are sending the URL around for data collection but want to control which group your participants end up in.

For example, the **AdvancedTutorial** experiment has two groups.  
  + If a participant clicks the default URL `https://expt.pcibex.net/ibexexps/angelicapan/AdvancedTutorial/experiment.html`, then they will be assigned to group `A` or `B` depending on the internal counter.
  + If a participant clicks the link `https://expt.pcibex.net/ibexexps/angelicapan/AdvancedTutorial/server.py?withsquare=0`, then they will be assigned to group `A`.
  + If a participant clicks the link `https://expt.pcibex.net/ibexexps/angelicapan/AdvancedTutorial/server.py?withsquare=1`, then they will be assigned to group `B`.
