## Selecting an image with a mouse click

The participant selects an image by pressing the `F` or `J` key. We'll include the option of clicking on an image to select it by using a [**Selector**]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector){:target="_blank"}. 

A **Selector** creates a group of elements, where (by default) each member can be selected with a mouse click. We can then associate a key to each member, so that a keypress will also select the desired element. 

{% capture instructions %}
+ Remove the `"keypress"` `Key`.
+ Create a [**Selector**]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector){:target="_blank"} named `"selection"`.
  1. Call the [`add`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-add){:target="_blank"} command to add the `"singular"` and `"plural"` `Image` elements
  2. Call the [`keys`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-keys){:target="_blank"} command to associate the `F` and `J` keys to the singular image and plural image, respectively. 
  3. Call the [`log`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-log){:target="_blank"} command to log information about the participant's selection.
  4. Call the [`once`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-once){:target="_blank"} command so that only the first image selection is valid (without the `once` command, the participant can change the selected image, up until the trial ends).
  5. Call the [`wait`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-wait){:target="_blank"} command to pause experiment script execution until the participant selects an element.

## Creating a timeout

The `"experimental-trial"` trial ends after audio playback finishes or a valid keypress, [whichever comes second]({{site.baseurl}}/basic-tutorial/#option3){:target="_blank"}.

We'll modify the trial so that it ends after whichever comes *first*:

+ If the participant presses a valid key while audio playback is still ongoing, the trial ends after the keypress.
+ If audio playback finishes before the participant presses a valid key, the trial ends after audio playback finishes.

In other words, the participant has until the audio playback finishes to press a valid key, otherwise the trial times out and ends. 

{% capture instructions %}
+ Create a timeout:
  1. Create and start a [`Timer`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/timer){:target="_blank"} named `"timeout"` that is `row.duration` ms long.
  2. Call the [`callback`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/selector/selector-callback){:target="_blank"} command on the `"selection"` **Selector**. When an image is selected, the `callback` command will stop the `"timeout"` `Timer`. Remove the `once` and `wait` commands.
  3. Call the [`wait`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/timer/timer-wait){:target="_blank"} command on the `"timeout"` `Timer` to pause experiment script execution until the timer stops.
  4. Call the [`stop`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/audio/audio-stop){:target="_blank"} command on the `"audio"` `Audio` to stop audio playback when the timer stops. Remove the `wait("first")` command.

</code></pre>
{% endcapture %}
{% include instructions.html text=instructions %}

The timeout is created as follows:

1. The `"timeout"` `Timer` starts right after the `"audio"` `Audio` starts playing. The `"timeout"` `Timer` and the `"audio"` `Audio` are both `row.duration` ms long.
2. Experiment script execution continues until it reaches the `wait` command on the `"timeout"` `Timer` element. The `wait` command pauses experiment script execution until PennController detects an end-of-timer event.
3. If the participant selects an image before audio playback finishes:
    + The participant selects an image. The `callback` command on the `"selection"` **Seleector** triggers the execution of `getTimer("timeout").stop()`, which stops the `"timeout"` `Timer` element and validates the `wait` command.
    
    *OR*
    
    If audio playback finishes before the participant selects an image:
    + The `"timeout"` `Timer` element stops naturally and validates the `wait` command.
4. Experiment script execution continues. The `stop` command is called on the `"audio"` `Audio` element. There are no more commands, so the trial "times out" and ends.

## Adding a trial delay

Each trial begins as soon as the previous trial ends. This might be overwhelming for participants, so we'll create a one-second pause between trials. 

{% capture instructions %}
Create and start a `Timer` named `"break"` that is 1000ms long. Call the [`wait`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/timer/timer-wait){:target="_blank"} command to pause experiment script execution until the timer stops:

## Using CSS styles

The [`css`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/standard-element-commands/standard-css){:target=":blank"} and [`cssContainer`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/standard-element-commands/standard-csscontainer){:target=":blank"} commands are equivalent to using [inline CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp){:target="_blank"} to apply a style or styles. The `css` command applies the CSS style(s) to the specified element, and the `cssContainer` command applies the CSS style(s) to the container of the specified element.

{% capture instructions %}
+ Update the instructions to reflect the changes in the `"experimental-trial"` trial.
+ Call the [`cssContainer`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/standard-element-commands/standard-csscontainer){:target=":blank"} command on the `defaultText` object to add a 1em bottom margin to every `Text` element container. 
+ Remove the `<p></p>` tags.

<pre><code class="language-diff-javascript diff-highlight"> 
@// code omitted in interest of space
@
@// Instructions
@newTrial("instructions",
@    defaultText
+        .cssContainer({"margin-bottom":"1em"})
@        .center()
@        .print()
@    ,
@    newText("instructions-1", "Welcome!")
@    ,
!    newText("instructions-2", "In this experiment, you will hear and read a sentence, and see two images.")
@    ,
@    newText("instructions-3", "&lt;b&gt;Select the image that better matches the sentence:&lt;/b&gt;")
@    ,
!    newText("instructions-4", "Press the &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; key to select the image on the left.&lt;br&gt;Press the &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; key to select the image on the right.&lt;br&gt;You can also click on an image to select it.")
+    ,
+    newText("instructions-5", "If you do not select an image by the time the audio finishes playing,&lt;br&gt;the experiment will skip to the next sentence.")
@    ,
@    newButton("wait", "Click to start the experiment")
@        .center()

@        .wait()
@)
@
@// code omitted in interest of space
</code></pre>
{% endcapture %}
{% include instructions.html text=instructions %}

We're calling the `cssContainer` command instead of using the `<p></p>` HTML tags in order to better control the vertical line spacing.

{% capture content %}
It's possible to use `<p></p>` tags instead of calling the `cssContainer` command:

<pre><code class="language-diff-javascript diff-highlight"> 
* // code omitted in interest of space
@
@// Instructions
@newTrial("instructions",
@    defaultText
@        .center()
@        .print()
@    ,
@    newText("instructions-1", "Welcome!")
@    ,
@    newText("instructions-2", "&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, you will hear and read a sentence, and see two images.&lt;/p&gt;")
@    ,
@    newText("instructions-3", "&lt;b&gt;Select the image that better matches the sentence:&lt;/b&gt;")
@    ,
!    newText("instructions-4", "&lt;p&gt;Press the &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; key to select the image on the left.&lt;br&gt;Press the &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; key to select the image on the right.&lt;br&gt;You can also click on an image to select it.&lt;/p&gt;")
+    ,
+    newText("instructions-5", "&lt;p&gt;If you do not select an image by the time the audio finishes playing,&lt;br&gt;the experiment will skip to the next sentence.&lt;/p&gt;")
@    ,
@    newButton("wait", "Click to start the experiment")
@        .center()
@        .print()
@        .wait()
@)
@
@// code omitted in interest of space
</code></pre>

However, if you add `<p></p>` HTML tags to the `"instructions-5"` `Text`, then there will be two lines of space in between the `"instructions-4"` and `"instructions-5"` `Text` elements, because the `"instructions-4"` `Text` also has `<p></p>` tags.

If you don't add the `<p></p>` tags, then there won't be a line of space between the `"instructions-5"` `Text` and `"wait"` `Button`:

<div class="d-flex mb-4" style="flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: space-around;">
  <div class="centered-50">
    <img class="dotted-grey-dk-000" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/tutorials/double-p.png" alt="double-p">with <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags on <code>"instructions-5"</code>
  </div>
  <div class="centered-50">
    <img class="dotted-grey-dk-000" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/tutorials/no-p.png" alt="no-p">without <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags on <code>"instructions-5"</code>
  </div>
</div>

With the `cssContainer` command:
<img class="mt-2 dotted-grey-dk-000" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/tutorials/margin-bottom.png" alt="margin-bottom">

{% endcapture %}
{% include collapsible-block.html content=content summary="Click for more details" inner-border=true %}

## Adding a completion screen

We'll add a completion screen trial to the end of the experiment.

By default, PennController sends the experiment results to the PCIbex Farm server after all the trials have ended. Use the global command [`SendResults`]({{site.baseurl}}/commands/global-commands/sendresults){:target="_blank"} to manually control when PennController sends results, and send results *before* the completion screen trial begins. This will help ensure that participants don't close their web browser before the experiment results are sent and saved.

We'll create a `Button` and call the `wait` command on it to pause experiment script execution, so that participants have time to read the completion screen trial. 

However, there is no need for participants to go beyond this trial; the experiment is already over, and the results have already been sent. Pause experiment script execution indefinitely by calling the `wait` command on the `Button` *without* printing it. The participant will never be able to click the button, and the `wait` command will never be satisfied.

{% capture instructions %}
+ Call the [`SendResults`]({{site.baseurl}}/global-commands/sendresults){:target="_blank"} global command and label it `"send"`.
+ Create a new trial labeled `"completion_screen"`.
  + Create and print a centered `Text` named `"thanks"`.
  + Create a new `Button` named `"void"`. Call the [`wait`]({{site.baseurl}}/elements/button/button-wait){:target="_blank"} command on it, but do *not* print it to the screen.
